October 21st, 2021. That was the first time I saw you—heard you. A YouTube video, just another ordinary moment in time. But it wasn’t ordinary for me. Something sparked, something I had no control over. And that terrified me. Because I knew exactly what it was.
        
I tried to shake it off, pretend it was nothing. But I couldn’t. So, I followed you, TikTok, Instagram. That’s where it got messy. For me, of course. I tried talking to you, tried making sense of what I felt. Then you said you had someone. So, I did what I do best—I let go. Silently. Without a word.
        
I have a habit of walking away. But this time, I couldn’t.
        
I blocked you everywhere, convinced myself that was the end of it. And yet, fate cruel, relentless fate brought you back to me. October 20th, 2024. A TikTok video. Your eyes. And suddenly, everything I buried came clawing back to life.
        
So, I texted you. You didn’t remember me. I laughed it off, kept the humor going. But between every joke, every word, I was still spinning around the same truth.
        
I don’t know your name. I don’t know your age. I don’t know when you were born. And yet, none of that ever mattered. Because love doesn’t wait for logic.
        
Moonlit charm, here’s what I’ve been circling around all this time—
        
I am madly in love with you.
        
Yeah, it’s happening. I’m going against everything I once told myself. I could’ve said this before, but I knew where you stood—you were done with online things. And I wanted to say this right, to stand in front of you, to look into your eyes when I finally admitted it.
        
I know this might push you away. Maybe that was always how this was meant to end. But that doesn’t change anything.
        
I’ve loved you since the first moment I saw you. And I always will.
        
That’s the truth. No running, no pretending, no way around it. There you go your straight statement.`;

                    let char = text.charAt(i);
